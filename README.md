# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
Commercial banks accept many applications for credit cards. Many of them were rejected for various reasons, such as high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries about individual credit reports, for example. Manually analyzing these apps is common, error prone, and time consuming (and time is money!). Fortunately, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and almost all commercial banks do today. In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like a real bank would do. In this project a machine learning model will be created to predict whether a credit card application will be approved.
